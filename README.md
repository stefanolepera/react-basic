# react-basic

That is the final version of the first exercise we did in the Lesson 1 of the course.
I've removed the unnecessary code and added _a lot_ of comments.
Please check the files in the following orders: `index.js` then `App.js` then `SayHello.js` and then `CounterComponent.js`
Hopefully it should be pretty clear what is happening in any of these files and why we do certain things.

Please still use the code provided here: https://github.com/DuncanOgle/firebase-react-lesson-1 if you haven't finished the exercises first.

Remember to do `npm install` to get all the dependencies and `npm start` to run the code.
